# Critical Mass - Intern Application

### Work/Project Examples:
1. **C#.NET Application -** Application that allows users to administer data stored in the database. Basically, perform CRUD operations on multiple tables inside the database.
2. **ASP. NET Application-** Application includes a Sign-up and Login page which the user can use to view data from database and perform CRUD operations.

3. **Android Application -** Similar to applications mentioned above but built for android.

### Inspiration:
1. Every time [Apple](https://www.apple.com/ca/) launches a new product, they always do something different with scroll events on their website. For e.g. The new [iMac 24"](https://www.apple.com/ca/imac-24/) webpage uses scroll event to change colours and attach the power connecter to the iMac. There is always something new to learn from their website.

2. Just the other day I was just browsing through random Web Design portfolios and I came across [Bruno Simon's](https://bruno-simon.com/#cybertruck) portfolio. It wasn't just a portfolio; it was a whole experience. The best part was that the car had inertia, it felt like it had some weight to it, which is definitely something that I want to learn, and try to replicate someday.

3. Every website has Error pages, but the way [Github](https://github.com/404) does its Error pages is something that I really like. The only purpose of an error page is to send the message across to the user that something went wrong but Github even included parallax animation which is totally unnecessary and I love it. 

### Focus:
I have been meaning to learn React for a while now, but its hard to learn something if you don't have a project to work on. That is why I love assignments; we get all the guidelines and it becomes much easier to break the learning process into small attainable checkpoints. Working with experienced individuals will also help me to be much more efficient in my learning process.
